            <h4>What is Morse Code</h4>
            <p>Morse is a type of communication method in which letters, alphabets, punctuation marks, and numerical are arranged in dots, dashes, and spaces. In this particular method, the text is transmitted in the form of electric pulses, Analogous mechanical
                and visual signals like series of lights in the way experts can understand it without the help of the external device. The morse system is well- defined, spontaneous, and ready-to-use method used to have effective communication in the
                earlier period. There are three types of morse systems like American morse, continental morse, and international morse. All the systems are quite similar to each other but the international morse system is easier and precise comparatively.
                Initially, the morse code system was popular with amateur radio operators but it is no longer being used in any sector. Now, even it is not necessary to adopt this code system if you are seeking a career as a US pilot or air traffic controller.
            </p>
            <h4>Morse Code History</h4>
            <p>The first morse code system was invented by an American inventor Samuel F.B. Morse in 1830. He introduced this system when he was working with an electrical telegraphy system used for sending pulses of electric current. “What God hath wrought.”
                was the first message transmitted in 1844 and in the same year Samuel Morse also patented this invention. During the initial days, this code was used to transmit only numbers, and the receivers used to refer dictionaries to translate numbers
                into words. The original version of the morse code was further developed by one of the assistants of Samuel morse and an American scientist named Alfred Lewis Vali. After some period of the invention of the morse code system, it was observed
                that the set of code is not sufficient for transmitting text in any other language except English due to being lacked in code for letters with dielectric marks. In 1951, the morse code system was structured by the conference of European
                nations to define cod for letters with diacritic marks. This newly developed system is also known as Continental Morse Code. The international morse code was developed by Friedrich Clement Gerke in 1848. It was used for electronic telegraphy
                in Germany. In 1865, this re-developed morse code system was regularised at the International Telegraphy Congress in Paris and further developed the standard by International Telecommunication Union. The morse code day is observed on 27
                April every year.
            </p>
            <h4>How does Morse Code work?</h4>
            <p>Generally, Morse code uses a structured combination of dots and dashes to define different letters. American morse code uses the different patterns of dots and spaces for the representation of some of the letters while the international morse
                system uses such a combination to represent all the letters. Apart from this, the major difference between the international and American systems is the length of the dashes used in the text. In American morse code uses dashes of varying
                lengths and in the case of the international morse code, these dashes are of fixed length. For example, the commonly used word "SOS" is transmitted with the help of three dots and their dashes. The dots are used to mention the letter "S"
                and dashes are used to denote the letter "O"
            </p>
            <h4>Morse Code Alphabet and numbers </h4>
            <p>
                The morse code alphabets is a simple set where each letter and number is structured with unique code combining dots and dashes. It consists of 26 English letters from A to Z, none English letters, Arabic numerical, and also a set of prosigns. In this
                particular system, there is no difference between upper case and lower case letters is observed. The sentences formed by morse alphabets are unreliable and do not consist of any logical order. One has to figure out the frequency of the
                various letters used in a sentence to understand which letter is most used and which is least. In the case of morse code transmission, dot duration worked as the unit of the time measurement. Every dot or dash used in character is distinguished
                by three dots which denotes space and words are separated by seven dots to denote space.

                <h4>Advantage of Morse code</h4>
                <p>Easy and effective communication In a time when various communication systems across the globe were not developed, Morse code assists well for effective communication even at the long distance.
                </p>

                <h4>Interesting facts of Morse code system </h4>
                <p>1. It is being used for around 170 years, longer as compared to other electronic coding systems.<br> 2. Though it is the oldest communication method, the morse code system is still used by Amateur radio controllers. <br> 3. Mr. Samuel
                    Morse, an inverter of morse code system earlier used to work as a painter.<br> 4. One can also speak morse code.
                    <br> 5. The "SOS" signal is also introduced due to morse code. </p>


                <h4>How does Morse Code work?</h4>
                <p>Generally, Morse code uses a structured combination of dots and dashes to define different letters. American morse code uses the different patterns of dots and spaces for the representation of some of the letters while the international
                    morse system uses such a combination to represent all the letters. Apart from this, the major difference between the international and American systems is the length of the dashes used in the text. In American morse code uses dashes
                    of varying lengths and in the case of the international morse code, these dashes are of fixed length. For example, the commonly used word "SOS" is transmitted with the help of three dots and their dashes. The dots are used to mention
                    the letter "S" and dashes are used to denote the letter "O"
                </p>
                <h4>Morse Code Alphabet and numbers </h4>
                <p>
                    The morse code alphabets is a simple set where each letter and number is structured with unique code combining dots and dashes. It consists of 26 English letters from A to Z, none English letters, Arabic numerical, and also a set of prosigns. In this

                    the various letters used in a sentence to understand which letter is most used and which is least. In the case of morse code transmission, dot duration worked as the unit of the time measurement. Every dot or dash used in character
                    is distinguished by three dots which denotes space and words are separated by seven dots to denote space.

                <h4>How to learn morse code?</h4>
                <p>
                    1. Understand the basics The initial step to learn morse code is to know the alphabet and numbers. Make a chart of if and try to understand each letter and basic signals carefully. Morse code is composed of dots and dashes and it is important to know
                    these patterns to recognize the text written in morse code. Along with this also try to learn how to pronounce each letter and number. <br> 2. Listen and visualize more Visualization is the most effective technique
                    to learn a new language efficiently in less period. Try to visualize the morse code text, again and again, to capture it easily. Apart from this audio clips in morse code will also help you to understand the language thoroughly. <br>                    3. Formation of words and sentences Once you are done with basic alphabets and numerical go for the formation of small words. Try to note some common words used in your daily routine to make your learning process simple. Keep revising
                    whatever you have learned frequently. Some of the common words in morse code 73 means best regards I.e best greeting which is written as --... ...-- in morse code The meaning of "TU" is "Thank you" and it is written as - ..- "143"
                    means "I love you mean" can be written as .---- ....- ...-- PLS denotes the word please and can be written as .--. .-.. ... SOS is used for international call do help and written as ... .-.-.- --- .-.-.- ... <br>4. Take help of external
                    devices There are various apps are available to assist you to adopt a new language or skills easily. "AA9PW" and “The Mill.” are a few good apps to start your process of learning online. Moreover, you can also refer to some good articles
                    books related to the morse code to learn it properly.
                    <br>5. Practice is a key To be proficient in the language keep practicing it by reading, writing, and listening to it regularly. Make charts, videos, or audio clips of morse code handy to go through it whenever you will get free time.
                    In this way, you will be able to adopt the language with good speed and proficiency.

                    Morse code applications
                </h4>
                <p>
                    The following mentioned are the common applications of morse code used universally.<br> 1. Naval forces Morse code has played a notable role during World War II to help NAVY for transmission of messages to the longer distance in a
                    secured way. The combination of three dots and a dash from the letter V in morse code and the letter V was used in world war ll to denote history.<br> 2. Amateur radio It is most commonly used by amateur radio operators to operate
                    the "continuous wave". Morse code is applied as a pattern to on and off the transmitter in radio communication mode. It was made mandatory by International Telecommunication Union (ITU) to have proficiency in morse code system for
                    amateur radio licensing but after 2003 it was made optional.

                <h4>How does Morse Code work in other language </h4><br>
                <p>
                    Morse code is really only useful in English. But we can use it in other languages too. In 1848, German writer Friedrich Clemens Clarke revised Morse Code to create the Hamburg alphabet, which included letters like “ü” and “ö.” Clarke’s proposal became
                    the basis for International Morse Code, which was adopted in 1865 as the main code for the world. International Morse Code has been changed and expanded in the centuries since then. This same sort of system was easily adapted for a
                    number of other languages that don’t use the Latin alphabet. Greek and Arabic, for example, just applied the system to their own letters without much trouble. The real trouble came from languages that have a much larger set of possible
                    characters. One of the hardest macrolanguages to use Morse Code on is Chinese because there are thousands of possible characters. To solve this problem, Chinese speakers (or telegraphers) took a page from Samuel Morse’s original plan
                    for Morse Code, and instead of having dots and dashes apply directly to symbols in the language, they applied only to numbers. Then, the Chinese Commercial Code was created, assigning Chinese characters to a four-digit code.

                <h4>The future of Morse Code </h4><br>
                <p>Morse Code is no longer widely used but is still remarkable in its ability to communicate. If more people understood it, there could certainly be more uses for it today. At the same time, Morse Code shows the limitations of systems that
                    are designed with a single language in mind. It took decades for formal systems to go into effect that could accommodate languages besides English. The same could be said for a number of technologies today, so this is a lesson worth
                    learning from.
